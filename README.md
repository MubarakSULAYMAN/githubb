<!-- ## Some ignored ~~/ pended~~ features

- [ ] Data optimization was ignored as the app loads all data required on initial load thereby making it overhead cost of usage relatively costly for a user.
- [ ] Country selection is not available neither is geolocation detection present.
- [ ] Local storage implementation for history. Current app session manages the storage instead.
- [ ] AI or Smart suggestion of "also read". Currently, it is based on the API default sorting of "publishedAt".
- [ ] Refresh of "selected news pages"
- [ ] Delay to simulate the loading of the "selected news pages".
- [ ] Delay to simulate the fetching of datas in all sections after first loading.
- [ ] Full app testing and test coverage -->
